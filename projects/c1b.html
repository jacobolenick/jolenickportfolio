                <p>I was able to keep the number of components down by utilizing variables and properties. 

                    This helped save my team money with their budget and Figma bill by making sure the usage of the file didn’t reach it’s limit. </p>

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Led the design and implementation of a comprehensive design system for a major credit card company, establishing design standards and component libraries that improved consistency across all digital products.</p>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>C1B needed a Figma/Angular Design System for their internal suite software that helps run the bank. 

                    They also needed it designed in a way with clear documentation and great collaboration so the dev team could implement components, variables, and tokens with ease and quick... So the other dev teams could build the screens. </p>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>User Story</h2>
                <p>We need to follow WCAG AA compliance rules and guidelines to ensure the product is accessible to all</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>User Story</h2>
                <p>We need a customer panel that is dynamic and encompasses the following. This will be one of the more complex components we will need to build.
                <ul>
                    <li>Customer info</li>
                    <li> Customer card+accounts</li>
                    <li>Search + Advanced search through filtering</li>
                    <li>Recent history</li>
                    <li>pricing strategy</li>

                <h2>Better the library performance</h2>
                <p>Strategically building components with well structured properties helps me keep my Design Systems files storage down which then allows the files to run faster when working in them. 

                    Not to mention it saves on my teams budget by not paying extra fees for meeting storage limits.</p>
