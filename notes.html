                        <p>Creating a design system that scales requires thoughtful planning and a deep understanding of your organization's needs. It's not just about building components—it's about creating a living ecosystem that evolves with your product.</p>
                        
                        <p>One of the most important lessons I've learned is to start small and iterate. Don't try to build everything at once. Focus on the most commonly used components and patterns first, then expand as you understand how teams are actually using the system.</p>

                        <p>Mentorship has been one of the most rewarding aspects of my design career. Whether I'm the mentor or the mentee, I always come away with new perspectives and insights that shape how I approach problems.</p>
                        
                        <p>The best mentorship relationships are built on mutual respect and genuine curiosity. It's not about having all the answers—it's about asking the right questions and creating space for growth and experimentation.</p>

                        <p>Figma's component properties and variants have revolutionized how we build design systems. The key is understanding when to use each approach and how to structure your components for maximum flexibility without overcomplicating them.</p>
                        
                        <p>I've found that the best component architectures balance flexibility with simplicity. Too many variants can make components overwhelming, while too few can limit their usefulness. Finding that sweet spot comes with experience and user feedback.</p>

                        <p>Maintaining consistency across different platforms while respecting platform conventions is one of the biggest challenges in product design. The goal isn't to make everything look identical—it's to create a cohesive experience that feels native to each platform.</p>
                        
                        <p>This requires deep understanding of platform guidelines, close collaboration with developers, and a design system that can flex to accommodate platform-specific patterns while maintaining brand consistency.</p>
